# HIV/AIDS Global Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of HIV/AIDS data across multiple countries using **Power BI**, **SQL Server**, and **Python**. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders, health professionals, and researchers understand the patterns of HIV treatment coverage, gaps, and other epidemiological indicators.

---

## 💡 Objectives

- Analyze ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) coverage rates for adults and children.
- Visualize regional disparities in treatment and case counts.
- Identify treatment gaps and trends over time.
- Provide actionable insights through interactive visualizations.
